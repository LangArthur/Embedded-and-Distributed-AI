## Assignment 1: Object detection

this project is seperate in two differents problems

### problem 1: Picture matching

This projet match a picture (called template) into another one.

Pictures are given inside the repository, but you can create your own templates with -e flag.

### problem 2: Person detection

This project detect the number of person on a picture.

Note: we were not able to upload weights for the model. To do so, download the weights, config and names from Yolov3 and place them in a folder Assignment1_Object-Detection/darknet/ (to the teacher: we copied the weights from the workshop nÂ°2. If it's not exaclty weights from Yolov3, can you warn us about the specificity of your weights?).
